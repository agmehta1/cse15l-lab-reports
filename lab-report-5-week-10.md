## How to find tests with different results
* I found the tests with different results by using ```diff``` on terminal. I used the command ```diff cse15l-markdown-parse/markdown-parse/result.txt you-markdown-parse/markdown-parse/result.txt``` which outputed all the differences between the two result files.

* This gave the lines in the result files to look at. Then in those files I compared the line and was able to see the differences in output. 

## Test 194
I decided to look at test 194
* The code in the file is ![image](194_code.png)
* The output from the given markdown parse was: ![image](194_prof.png)
* The output from my markdown parse was: ![image](194_mine.png)
* The expected output was: ![image](194_actual.png)



## Test 510
I decided to look at test 510
* The code in the file is ![image](510_code.png)
* The output from the given markdown parse was: ![image](510_profs.png)
* The output from my markdown parse was: ![image](510_mine.png)
* The expected output was: ![image](510_actual.png)
